The UI is ugly as hell, I know and I hate looking at it. I am not sure exactly how I will clean it up yet (I will take suggestions) but it works!

Here is how it works! First you take a scout report from turtle and click the EXPORT button at the top right. Then click the IMPORT button to import all the data into the plugin.

Now your main window had 3 main sections. The right side is your list of A Ranks. They are sorted by patch (drop down at the top allows you to change with patch you see). The top monster is the one you are currently about to hunt.

The edit box on the top left is your message you plan to send out. There are placeholders that you can use here to customize your messages ...

<target> will be replaced with the name of the A Rank (Queen Hawk)
<location> will be replaced with <flag> and a link is generated prior for the location of the X and Y from the list for this A Rank

The Send To section allows you to decide which chats to send the information to. Echo is in there so you can test it out without anyone else seeing.
Clicking the Send button will send the message in the edit box above after being parsed to the respected chats.

Now this might seem like this is nice, but WAIT ... THERE IS MORE!

Click the SETTINGS button on the menu bar!

Yes, you are seeing this right ... you can actually set up your Discord Message in advance and also auto send a message to your chats that you choose. The edit boxes up top are what you fill in, the bottom ones won't let you type because they just show you what will be output.

There is a copy button for the Discord message so you can paste it in Discord without much effort.

Placesholders:

<server> Your current server
<expansion> The expansion from the drop down on this page (not the main window)
<location> The location of where you are starting your train (for announcements, this creates a flag and turns to <flag>
<name> Puts your name in there (pointless I know but I enjoyed making the parsing)
<@> This one is specifically for the Discord side, it puts in the @ for Discord if you are posting to Faloop's discord. There is an issue where you have to backspace once you paste and then select it because their image is unique, working on fixing this though.
<time> In discord, this is a discord timestamp that will tell tell everyone how long until it starts (counts down automatically). In Announcement Message, it will put the time frame in minutes until start (10 minutes)

Remember that this is for you to add your own custom messages but not have to worry about changing the format you like that often.

If you have any suggestions, SPECIALLY ABOUT THE UI because I do believe the UI needs some love, please feel free to let me know!
