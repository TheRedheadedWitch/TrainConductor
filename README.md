# Train Conductor
Train Conductor was created because out of all the resources I could find, they were mostly for those who benefited from those conducting trains and not about helping people actually conduct them. Well ... it's time to change that and here we are!

If you like this plugin and find it useful, please consider donating to my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/theredheadedwitch).

I wrote this program to save time conducting trains. To test it, I had to learn how to conduct trains and run them myself. First thing I learned, it was very tedious. A lot of preparing in advance! Well, no longer is that the case!

I didn't want everyone seeing the same messages that used the plugin, people would know ... I didn't want this. Train Conductor has no default messages, you create your own to be unique to you! So you can be as basic or as complex as you like! Setting up messages is easy, you type your message in the message text box and view it in the section that shows the output, then you use it. The catch is that Train Conductor uses placeholders just like FFXIV, though our placeholders are not case sensative like FFXIV. A list of all placeholders can be found by clicking the ? in the menu bar at the top of the window.

Some features I built in are.

> Automatic purging of monsters when they die.<br>
> Send won't allow you to resend for 3 seconds to prevent accidental spamming<br>
> Faloop's A Train Discord easy to copy message (don't forget <@> for the automatical role)

Importing monsters into the plugin does take a whole 5 seconds. You have to actually go to your browser where you have your https://scout.wobbuffet.net/ scout report and click that export button at the top right of the web page, then click the import button on the plugin. I know it requires 2 whole button clicks which is a lot of work ... I will look into a way to speed this up eventually!

So 2 clicks, and you have your monsters imported. They are automatically removed as you go. You have your custom message which saves automatically and loads each time you open the plugin, so it is ready to go. You just have to click that SEND button each time you want to broadcast the next location. I know ... I know ... that is a lot of work to ask you to do but if I automated it from the previous kill's death, then Dalamud would have flagged it as automation and it would not pass the approval process. If this is a feature that you REALLY ... REALLY want then I can be persuaded to set up a second repository for it as a 3rd party plugin. Personally though, I like clicking that send button each time so I would ask you give it a try first before considering complete automation of it.

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please submit them so I can get on them.
